> ### Example Crystal/Kemal codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-example-apps) spec and API.


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Crystal and Kemal** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Crystal and Kemal** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
